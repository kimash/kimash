### About
I'm a software developer and artist based in NYC. My career has been focused on the VFX and experience design industries. Most recently, I was a Lead Software Developer at Technicolor. Most of my code from the last 9 years has been proprietary, so I'm working on building some new examples to post here.

I work primarily in Python and C++, but I also enjoy teaching myself new languages. I like working with APIs and connecting different systems together. I also like GUIs and graphics.
